# Digispark Codes ⚡

This folder contains Arduino-compatible code specifically written for the **Digispark ATTiny85** board — a tiny but powerful USB development platform.

## 📁 What's in Here?

- ✅ `anti-afk.ino` — A USB HID script that simulates WASD keypresses to prevent AFK kicks in games
- 🚧 More examples coming soon (e.g., LED, mouse movement, button triggers, serial comms)

## 💡 Why Digispark?

Digispark boards are ideal for:
- Low-cost USB automation tools
- HID keyboards/mice
- Compact hardware hacks
- Projects where size and simplicity matter

## 🧰 Requirements

- Digispark ATTiny85 board (via USB)
- Arduino IDE with **Digispark support** installed
- The `DigiKeyboard` library (usually included with the Digispark core)

## 🚀 Uploading Code

1. Open your `.ino` file with the **Arduino IDE**
2. Go to **Tools > Board > Digispark (Default - 16.5 MHz)**
3. Click **Upload**
4. When prompted, plug in your Digispark

> 🔌 Pro Tip: Plug in the board only **after** hitting upload.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some sketches (like the Anti-AFK one) simulate keyboard inputs. Use responsibly. Misuse in games or online platforms may violate terms of service.
